# Hello! My name is Rebecca Romero and welcome to my first website! 
I'm a sophomore ISAT major and Im interested in possibly concentrating in Biotechnology!


## About me 
I am from Gainesville, Virginia where I graduated from Patriot High School. I have two twin sisters, my Dad is from Venezuela and my mom is from the Philippines. My dog is a maltichon, which is a mix between a maltese and a bishon and his name is Nico! I have been playing soccer for over 12 years and was co-captain my last 4 years! My position was center defense and I occasionally was goalie. I have worked at Chick-Fil-A for three years!

### My interests
I really enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love to go bike riding, hiking, skiing, camping, and I really enjoy going to the beach too. Some countries I have visited are Puerto Rico, Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Rupublic. However, I hope to travel all around the world in the future and explore other cultures! Im definetly an adrenaline junky and love to ride rollercoasters, so im sad that amusement parks like Kings Dominion or Busch Gardens are closed. 


### Programming in 252

The first program that ran successfully for me would be the Hello World! program as you can see from the screenshot. I didnt have any complications as it was simple to follow, however I was unable to bring up vs code from the terminal by the following command " code ." This wasnt detrimental because I just opened vs code manually and everything was there in my virtual environment.

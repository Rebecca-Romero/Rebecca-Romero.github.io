### My interests
I really enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love to go bike riding, hiking, camping, and I really enjoy going to the beach too. Some countries I have visited are Puerto Rico, Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Rupublic. However, I hope to travel all around the world in the future and explore other cultures! Im definetly an adrenaline junky and love to ride rollercoasters, so im sad that amusement parks like Kings Dominion or Busch Gardens are closed. :pensive:
